The contract Elevator has a serious security vulnerability in the goTo() function. The smart contract is supposed to change the floor only if `_floor` is not the last floor, and then set the `top` variable by checking the `isLastFloor()` function. 

However, this code is vulnerable because it automatically trusts the caller of the function. The problem is specifically in the line calling the external contract:

`Building building = Building(msg.sender);`

This allows any contract (denoted as msg.sender) that has an `isLastFloor()` function on it to modify state variables (`floor` and `top`) in this contract. This opens up the possibility for reentrancy attacks and broken access controls.

A malicious actor could create a contract that behaves unexpectedly when calling `isLastFloor()`. For instance, they might make it return `false` initially when checking if it's the last floor during the first call, and then `true` in the next call, which manipulates the stage of the Elevator contract.

The two calls to `building.isLastFloor()` in the function `goTo()` could potentially provide different results if a malicious contract were to modify its state between the first and the second call. This re-entrancy could potentially result in unexpected behavior of the Elevator contract. 

To mitigate this issue, only trusted contracts should be allowed to interact with the smart contract or factors like who is calling the contract and how functions change the state of the contract should be considered before coding the functions. Considering re-entrancy guards like mutex mechanisms can also help avoid potential threats. Furthermore, checks-effects-interactions pattern could be used to ensure that no state changes after a call to an external contract.
